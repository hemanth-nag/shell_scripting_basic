# Basic Shell Scripting

A simple text file encoder/decoder implemented in bash commands. Uses ceasar cipher for text encoding.

Made it to remember basic bash and shell scripting commands.

Remember to change file permissions using chmod before executiong the file.

I have uploaded sample inputs and outputs.
